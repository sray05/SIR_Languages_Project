<p>Rasmus Lerdorf created PHP in 1994. It was a simplistic parser engine that understood special macros and utilities in common use on homepages in the 90's. It would consist of a guestbook, a counter, and other stuff. It was then rewritten in 95' and renamed PHP/FI Version 2. The FI part came from another package Rasmus had written that interpreted HTML form data. Rasmus combined the Personal Home Page tools and scripts with the Form Interpreter and added mSQL support and PHP/FI was born. PHP/FI. PHP is used to script websites meant for dynamic and interactive services. PHP is still strongly used and is the backbone of about 77% of all websites using a server-side language. <strong>grew fast</strong> and people started contributing code to it.</p>
